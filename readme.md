# Melon Game

## About

This is a personal version of a popular switch game. I tried rebuilding it in raylib and 
using box2d.

## Notes

When going GameOver the Application will terminate itself.

## To build 

You need libraylib and libbox2d for your system. Change the make file accordingly and run: 

```bash
    make;
    ./Suika
```
